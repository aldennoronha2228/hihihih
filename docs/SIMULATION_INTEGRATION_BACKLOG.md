# Simulation integration backlog — exhaustive catalog/registry inventory

## Scope and reconciliation

Read-only source inspection on 2026-10-08. This document is the only requested write; no implementation, model, engine, metadata, or test changes were made. No browser/firmware tests were executed for this inventory. “Enabled” below means actual source admission, not newly verified behavior.

**172 is the backend catalog count, not the PartSimulationRegistry count.** Both public metadata catalogs contain 157 entries. `backend/hardware.py::ComponentCatalog` adds eight missing board entries and seven schematic source/ground entries, giving **172 distinct IDs**. The full upstream `simulation/parts/index.ts` side-effect imports yield **83 registry IDs**, including eight dynamically registered ePaper IDs: **78 catalog matches and five registry-only IDs**. All 172 catalog IDs are classified below; the five additional registry IDs are separately inventoried.

**Current `src/hardware/velxioParts.ts` selects 13 IDs:** potentiometer, slide-potentiometer, servo, hc-sr04, rgb-led, dht22, ssd1306, ssd1306-i2c-4pin, lcd1602-i2c, lcd2004-i2c, mpu6050, ds1307, ds3231. Local LED/pushbutton behavior is separate. Eager imports include only PartSimulationRegistry, ComplexParts, SensorParts, ProtocolParts and supporting tracing/update/line modules, not the full upstream parts index. Loading a handler is not selecting it, binding its engine dependencies, or certifying its pins/power.

**130 of 172 IDs have empty backend-approved `pins`; 42 have nonempty pins.** Backend wiring legality comes from explicit `PIN_LAYOUTS`, not metadata `pinCount`. Frontend `HardwarePart` reads DOM `pinInfo` for geometry, but that does not make those labels legal for backend `connect_wire`. For example BMP280 metadata/element exposes four pins while its backend entry exposes none. Some pinless IDs are intentionally wireless/topological; others are concrete wiring blockers.

## Classification and dependency profiles

Every catalog row below contains an exact ID, source model/classification, actual backend pins, and a dependency profile. Profiles are part of each row's classification, not a claim that every member has identical hardware behavior.

- **I:** admitted by current VelxioParts; board/power/pin/protocol restrictions still apply.
- **L:** existing local digital behavior outside upstream registry integration.
- **R:** actual upstream handler exists but is not admitted. **P** means missing backend pins and/or controls.
- **S:** existing upstream SPICE emitter; current app whitelist/live MCU bridge does not admit it.
- **A:** existing separate schematic ngspice path, not an MCU peripheral.
- **E:** existing upstream digital engine/controller needs binding; no exact part-registry handler.
- **T:** topology, not an attachEvents model.
- **B:** board runtime/configuration, not a part handler.
- **G:** insufficient/missing behavior or board admission, distinguished from missing adapters.

| Profile | Actual requirements and limitations |
|---|---|
| AVR | Existing AVRSimulator/avr8js CPU, GPIO, timers, ADC and UART. Uno/Nano/Mega admitted; peripheral scope is not inherited from CPU support. Nano A6/A7 are analog-only. |
| RP | Existing RP2040Simulator/rp2040js. Adapter enables rotary/slide potentiometers only on external GP26–GP28 with 3V3/GND. No GP29, second-core or USB CDC assurance; Pico W CYW43 wireless/onboard LED absent. |
| REMOTE | ESP boards need native QEMU/bridge configuration; Linux Pi needs native guest Linux/runtime. No normal admitted browser path for these boards, except separate experimental C3 described below. |
| POT | Existing ComplexParts ADC handler, input event; rotary SIG, slide SIG/OUT. AVR VCC=5V/GND and board ADC pin, Pico 3V3/GND. Slide min/max/value normalization; rotary 0–1023 voltage mapping. Reset ADC on detach. |
| ADC | Existing partUtils.setAdcVoltage and SensorUpdateRegistry. AVR writes volts to ADC channels (Uno A0–A5, Nano A0–A7, Mega A0–A15). NTC scales to board rail; photoresistor/gas/flame/sound hardcode 5V: initially scope these to Uno. Add actual input descriptors, initial saved-value synchronization, bounds and ADC cleanup. Indicator properties are not sensor input controls. |
| GPIO-IN | Explicit signal GPIO, real ground/supply and high-impedance pad ownership; reset seeded input on detach. Switches need correct contact wiring/pulls, not generic VCC validation. |
| GPIO-OUT | Existing PinManager digital/PWM subscriptions. Validate return path/current-limiting resistors where appropriate and capture output values; no solved current or safety certification. |
| LINE | Existing requestLine and guest pad/timing models; exclusive pin ownership, capability refusal, lease release and pending-edge stop policy. DHT22/HC-SR04 are already scoped to AVR; keypad/IR are not automatically enabled. |
| I2C | Existing project-local VelxioBus/BusRegistry/resolver/TWI binding. Current gate is Uno A4/SDA=18 and A5/SCL=19, explicit correct power/GND, validated address/collision diagnostics. It intercepts attachI2c only during synchronous attach; global hooks restored in finally. No SPI or other-board I2C admission. |
| SPI | Reuse existing upstream SPI fabric and engine hooks, SCK/MOSI/CS plus MISO where applicable; DC/RST/BUSY GPIO for displays. Current VelxioBus binds spi: [] and does not intercept attachSpiDevice, so extending selected is insufficient. Scope handles/reset/diagnostics and virtual output ownership. |
| UART | Reuse existing UART fabric, endpoint/net resolver, guest clock and conflict-safe serial ownership. Current VelxioBus omits UART and does not intercept attachUartEndpoint. |
| PIXEL | Existing WS2812 decoder needs actual guest cycles/nanos and DIN edges or hardware subscribeWs2812 feed. AVR bit-bang is the safest first scope; RP PIO/ESP RMT feeds are not guaranteed by CPU support. Isolate upstream run-epoch/power-cut store subscriptions and test blanking/chain routing. |
| NET | Existing handlers/engines require peripheral/virtual nets, thresholds and drive-contention propagation. Current resolver traces to MCU pins and rejects active crossings; it cannot cover arbitrary gate chains or driver outputs. Reuse upstream Interconnect/PinResolver/digitalGateEngine/controller and existing bridges, not a new engine. |
| ELECTRICAL | Real upstream componentToSpice mapper; exact polarity/package pins and defaults, existing solver/netlist integration needed. Current local analogPins excludes these IDs; HardwareRuntime has no live MCU/SPICE voltage/current feedback. Never replace nonlinear devices with fake GPIO models. |
| PASSIVE | Real upstream R/L/C preset/base SPICE mapper; preset value and polarity preserved. Local analog whitelist excludes preset IDs, backend pins empty. No attachEvents needed; broaden existing solver/schema only if requested. |
| TOPOLOGY | Existing upstream PinTrace/NetlistBuilder breadboard/node topology. Expose real labels and shared-net routing. Local LED/button connectedEndpoints crosses generic resistor only, not breadboard strips. |

### Common integration constraints

Selected parts require exactly one selected board. Trace/power checks must remain board-specific, reject active-device crossing, unwired fallback and invalid pin ranges. Rails are validated separately; current signal resolver returns null for rails, unlike upstream handlers that sometimes depend on -1 rail sentinel. A new passive switch cannot simply pass the existing generic VCC/V+ gate. Generic resistor traversal is digital continuity, not Ohm's law.

Property writes call `Object.assign` and dispatch numeric/boolean sensor updates; they do not automatically synthesize switch array changes, joystick motion events, or discrete PIR/tilt actions. Add legitimate controls and matching handler events/keys. Release callbacks, timers, GPIO seeds, ADC channels, audio and bus/line handles on stop/reset/removal/rewire. No-op cleanup does not prove a peripheral attached successfully.

## Group coverage

Counts preserve actual catalog categories, including `sensor` versus `sensors` and misplaced board IDs. Registry counts include callback-only stubs. The following summary and all per-ID rows are checked against the actual ComponentCatalog.

| Group | Catalog IDs | Registry matches | Adapter IDs | Nonempty backend pins |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| analog | 38 | 0 | 0 | 7 |
| boards | 12 | 1 | 0 | 12 |
| displays | 15 | 15 | 4 | 4 |
| electromech | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| input | 6 | 6 | 1 | 2 |
| logic | 25 | 18 | 0 | 0 |
| motors | 4 | 4 | 1 | 1 |

| **Total** | **172** | **78** | **13** | **42** |


## Upstream source abbreviations

All are under `vendor/velxio/frontend/src/simulation/parts/` unless specified: **Basic**=BasicParts.ts, **Complex**=ComplexParts.ts, **Sensor**=SensorParts.ts, **Protocol**=ProtocolParts.ts, **Chip**=ChipParts.ts, **Logic**=LogicGateParts.ts, **Motor**=MotorDriverParts.ts, **GPS**=GpsParts.ts, **ePaper**=EPaperPart.ts. **SPICE** means an exact emitter in `simulation/spice/componentToSpice.ts` (including preset aliases). ActiveParts explicitly does not register semiconductor attachEvents; a missing registry entry is not a missing electrical model.

## Complete per-ID inventory

Backend pins are literal approved labels; ∅ means no backend pins. Long board pin lists are counted and referenced to PIN_LAYOUTS. Physical pin requirements in notes are inspected handler/element contracts, not approved pins added by this report.

## Registry-only IDs — all five, outside the 172

| ID | Existing source/model | Required dependency / gap |
|---|---|---|
| `74hc595` | Chip: real shift/latch/OE/MR/Q-output behavior | Absent backend catalog ID/pins; add catalog/visual contract and Chip import, real/virtual output nets and store/DOM lookup bridge. Uses upstream wires and document.getElementById for connected outputs. |
| `custom-chip` | CustomChipPart/ChipInstance | Absent backend catalog ID; requires its own project wasmBase64, chipJson, dynamic pins/attrs, optional ROM, guest clock/pad/bus bridges. No compiled chip bytes means intentionally skipped behavior. |
| `ili9341-cap-touch` | Complex: alias to ILI9341 display handler | Absent backend catalog ID/pins; SPI profile. Alias covers display, not proof of touch-controller behavior. |
| `lcd2002` | Complex: 20×2 HD44780 decoder | Absent backend catalog ID/pins; parallel LCD contract and lifecycle. |
| `pcf8574` | Protocol: VirtualPCF8574 I2C target | Absent standalone backend catalog ID/pins; I2C + NET profiles, address/port-state/latch routing. Already used internally by I2C LCD backpacks; not standalone expander integration. |

## WASM and missing model distinction

**All five fixed bus WASMs are present** in app and vendor public bus-chips trees: bmp280.wasm, ds1307.wasm, ds3231.wasm, mpu6050.wasm, microsd.wasm. Their C/chip-json sources and i2cModelBytes.generated.ts are present under simulation/buses/models. Four I2C handlers prefer compiled Wasm models with VirtualBMP280/VirtualDS1307/VirtualDS3231/VirtualMPU6050 fallbacks if unavailable/disabled. BMP280 is therefore blocked by pins, controls and admission—not missing WASM. Browser microSD uses the existing SdSpiCard; portable WASM serves worker-hosted responders, not missing local SPI bindings.

OLED/LCD/TFT/ePaper, ADC sensors, switches, servo, NeoPixels, keypad and IR have existing JS/TS/line models; they need no invented WASM chip. Generic custom-chip is different: it requires project-specific compiled bytes and chip JSON. No arbitrary app public/chips precompiled chip catalog exists at the checked roots. The five fixed bus binaries cannot stand in for arbitrary chip firmware.

Actual model gaps:

- **ks2e-m-dc5:** registered callback only logs COIL1/COIL2; no implemented relay contact propagation, attachEvents or SPICE emitter.
- **ic-74hc00, ic-74hc02, ic-74hc04, ic-74hc08, ic-74hc14, ic-74hc32, ic-74hc86:** no exact PartSimulationRegistry entry/SPICE emitter. Visual packages and existing upstream digitalGateEngine/controller exist; binding that existing engine is the reuse route, not evidence of current app coverage. Do not silently substitute generic gate IDs for powered 14-pin packages.
- **franzininho, nano-rp2040-connect:** no admitted board/compiler/runtime configuration or sufficient part handler. Mis-categorized passive/other board visuals are not R/L/C or peripheral models.
- **custom-chip:** registry-only, needs its own missing project artifact/catalog integration. ili9341-cap-touch only establishes display alias behavior, not touch support.
- Native ESP/Linux board requirements are deployment/guest/bridge gaps. ESP32-C3 has an experimental browser core while backend catalog still advertises unavailable/QEMU; do not report certified Arduino execution.
- Missing registry entries for semiconductors, batteries, relays/L293D and R/L/C presets are generally expected electrical/topological coverage, not missing attachEvents. Photodiode's handler forwards lux only; its actual photocurrent behavior is SPICE.

## Safe next integrated batches — recommendations, not implementation

### Batch 1: Uno-only active sensors/sliders, switches and outputs

Safest reuse candidates: **ntc-temperature-sensor, photoresistor-sensor analog channel, analog-joystick, pir-motion-sensor, tilt-switch**, followed by **gas-sensor, flame-sensor, big-sound-sensor, small-sound-sensor** analog-only controls, and **slide-switch, led-bar-graph, buzzer**. Original handlers already exist; most candidates need exact backend pins and honest controls first. There is no justification for a new CPU/peripheral physics engine for these scoped behaviors.

- NTC: expose temperature slider and GND/VCC/OUT, reuse the existing 3950-beta 10k-divider ADC model; initialize from project temperature.
- Photoresistor: expose lux and VCC/GND/AO/DO. Scope to original Uno analog injection only; DO handler observes GPIO for LED, does not create a comparator output. Existing SPICE divider is a distinct physical model from the simple linear injection.
- Joystick: physical VERT/HORZ/SEL, two ADCs plus button GPIO. DOM xValue/yValue are -1/0/+1, while sensor dispatcher uses xAxis/yAxis ranges; match paths and synthesize required motion/button events.
- PIR/tilt: physical OUT with VCC/GND, discrete trigger/toggle actions rather than ordinary numeric property edits; PIR uses an existing 3-second browser timeout and cancels it, not an acoustic/environment model.
- Gas/flame/sound: add gasLevel/intensity/soundLevel descriptors (metadata currently often exposes only LEDs), 5V power and AOUT/DOUT. Match original defaults and saved state. DOUT is indicator observation only; don't advertise a nonexistent threshold comparator. Flame DOM input mapping differs from its panel mapping; reconcile before admission.
- Slide switch: pin 2 common, 1/3 throws to explicit GND/rail; original handler uses value as level and ignores throws. Validate real wiring/pulls/drive direction instead of replacing hardware with a click-to-GPIO shortcut.
- Bar graph: A1–A10/C1–C10; original handler observes anodes only. Validate each cathode return and current-limiting resistor, capture values, import BasicParts.
- Buzzer: legal backend 1/2 pins already exist and Complex handler is loaded but unselected. Validate signal/return, AudioContext user-gesture behavior, tone/PWM timing and teardown; start Uno.
- DIP switch is a subsequent bounded batch: lowercase 1a–8a/1b–8b, values array events/update bridge and B-side contact validation are required. Heartbeat follows after guest-clock/analog-GPIO ownership/ADC reset tests. Pushbutton-6mm is completion of a local branch's missing pin schema, not a new model.
- Rotary/slide potentiometers are already admitted. Remaining slider work is verification/catalog scope consistency: code permits AVR/Pico, catalog advertises slide Uno only; Pico slider firmware behavior is not certified by this inventory.

Before any candidate is marked integrated: real compiled Uno firmware must change ADC/serial/GPIO readings with controls; wrong/unwired power/GND/signal, active crossing and output contention must refuse or diagnose; saved values/reset must agree; stop/removal/rewire must release seeded ADC/GPIO/timers/audio; the existing 13 parts and local LED/button behavior must not regress. Browser appearance alone is insufficient. These acceptance tests were not run here.

### Batch 2: existing scoped Uno I2C fabric

**bmp280** is the safest next bus target: model and WASM already exist. Add exact SDA/SCL/GND/VCC, temperature/pressure/address controls, 0x76/0x77 validation, selected admission and sleep/collision diagnostics to existing Uno I2C infrastructure. Later enrich MPU6050 controls and explicitly certify RTC feature subsets. Standalone PCF8574 needs catalog and actual peripheral-port routing, not merely the already integrated backpack decoder.

### Batch 3 and structural work

Parallel LCD1602/LCD2004, matrix keypad, IR pair and AVR NeoPixel are feasible reuse but require pin/protocol/lifecycle/line/store isolation tests. KY-040 and rotary dialer leave nested timeouts pending; defer until safe teardown and declared timing scope. HX711 needs physical DT versus resolved DOUT correction and honest fixed-sample limitations. A4988/stepper needs graph/DOM/virtual-net binding and motor-supply policy; direct MCU-to-coil wiring is not a hardware-safe integration.

ILI9341/all eight ePaper panels/microSD need scoped existing SPI fabric; GPS needs scoped UART fabric and serial conflict handling. Gate chains, flip-flops, powered 74HC packages, shift registers, driver outputs and expander ports need existing peripheral/virtual-net engines. Semiconductors/preset passives/relay contacts need broader use of the already present SPICE solver and, for live firmware interaction, its voltage/current/threshold bridges. Board deployment/runtime and arbitrary custom-chip artifacts remain separate prerequisites.

**Integrating all components cannot be done by expanding selected.** Full pins/controls, existing bus/peripheral/virtual-net engine bindings, scoped store/DOM bridges, electrical feedback, deployed board runtimes and chip artifacts are required. Reuse these existing engines; no new engine is proposed or implemented.

## Evidence paths

Repository-relative paths are used for portability.

- backend/hardware.py: ComponentCatalog expansion, PIN_LAYOUTS, descriptors, board scope and API pin validation.
- public/components-metadata.json and vendor/velxio/frontend/public/components-metadata.json: 157 metadata IDs/categories/defaults.
- src/hardware/velxioParts.ts, velxioBus.ts, runtime.ts, part.tsx: actual selection, rail/pin/board gates, bus binding, local behavior, lifecycle and DOM geometry.
- src/hardware/spice.ts and spice-netlist.js: separate analog whitelist and existing solver/netlist reuse.
- vendor/velxio/frontend/src/simulation/parts/{PartSimulationRegistry,index,ActiveParts,BasicParts,ComplexParts,SensorParts,ProtocolParts,ChipParts,GpsParts,MotorDriverParts,LogicGateParts,CustomChipPart,EPaperPart,partUtils,wasmI2cModels}.ts: original models and handler dependencies.
- vendor/velxio/frontend/src/simulation/spice/componentToSpice.ts and displays/EPaperPanels.ts: exact electrical emitters/preset aliases and all eight generated panel registrations.
- vendor/velxio/frontend/src/simulation/buses/{busChips,registry,storeResolver,i2cBus,spiBus,uartBus}.ts, buses/models, line/models, digital: existing infrastructure.
- node_modules/@wokwi/elements/dist/esm/*-element.js and vendor components/velxio-components wrappers: actual physical pin names, including HX711 DT mismatch.
- public/bus-chips and vendor frontend/public/bus-chips: five present fixed compiled assets.
- Existing scope evidence, not executed: tests/{uno-peripherals,avr-peripherals,slide-potentiometer,pico-analog,dht-runtime,rgb-runtime,oled-runtime,lcd-runtime,i2c-sensors,uno-lifecycle}.spec.ts and backend catalog tests.
